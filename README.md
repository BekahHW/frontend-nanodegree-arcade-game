Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


Getting started

To play the game, you need to first fork the repo and then download it locally. Once you've done that, find the folder, right
click the index.html file, and open it in the browser of your choice. Once you've done that, you have access to the game board
and your character. You're ready to play.

To Play

The object of the game is to make it to the other side of the canvas without hitting any enemies. If you run into an enemy, your player will be reset to its original position. Once you make it to the blue blocks, you've won!
